# Text-Summarization
What is ROUGE?
ROUGE stands for Recall Oriented Understudy For Gisting Evaluation. It is essentially of a set of metrics for evaluating automatic summarization of texts as well as machine translation.It works by comparing an **automatically produced summary** or **translation** against a set of **reference summaries**(typically human produced).
Let us say, we have the following system and reference summaries:

**System Summary(what the machine produced)**
the cat was found under the bed 
**Reference Summary(gold standard -ususlly by humans)**
>the cat was under the bed
